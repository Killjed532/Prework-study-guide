## Usage / Getting Started
To use the website use the navigation panel in the header to select the topic or you may open
console by right-clicking and clicking inspect or using the command option-command-J on Mac. 
Next navigate to the top toolbar in the DevTool side window and press console. This will display
the JS script that is running and it will choose a topic to be studied at random.

### Installation
To view and run the code you should consider downloading a text-editor. During the project
I was using PyCharm Professional. There are other free options out there including VS Code and
Atom. I ran the JS scripts locally in PyCharm, if you want to do that make sure you have the proper
package to run it locally.
